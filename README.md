## About the Project

This project was built as a React & Redux Capstone project at Microverse.
It is based on the idea of a "Catalogue of Recipes" which is a single-page application with React and Redux.

It shows a browsable list of movies that users can filter and access to the details of each movie. Every page, the main page, and pages for each item have a unique route within the Single Page Application, SPA.

I deployed this app to Heroku, so it‚Äôs accessible online.
The data is retrieved from the Open Movie Database, [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).
With this API, this app fetches the list data of movies based on the user‚Äôs input. 
And the retrieved data is stored in the Redux store.

Also, it retrieves the particular movie data by searching a unique id in the background and update the data in the Redux store only when the unique id matches the data of the store.

This web app has 3 types of pages:

- one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters
In this project, it‚Äôs a list of movies that can be filtered by the title and the year of the movie.

- one page for the item details
In this project, it‚Äôs the movie detail page.

- one page for not found
If users input the wrong path directly, the app shows the 404 page.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful is listed in the acknowledgments.
