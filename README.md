## About the Project
Movisearch was built based on the idea of a "Catalogue of Recipes" which is a single-page application with React and Redux, showing a browsable list of movies that users can filter and access to the details of each movie.

The movies' data are retrieved from the Open Movie Database, [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/).
Once you input a keyword and choose the ages that the movie released, the app will retrieve the movies list from this API, and show them as a list on the main page.

When you click a certain movie's image from the list, it's going to show the movie's detail on the detail page.
